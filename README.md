The Real-Time Database Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to provide 
continuous oversight of database activities and performance metrics. Developed using the 
Django web framework, the system features a role-based access control mechanism, allowing 
users to access specific dashboards based on their rolesâ€”Admin, Moderator, or User. It enables 
real-time tracking of database queries, resource usage, and user interactions to ensure data 
integrity and operational efficiency. The admin panel supports full user management, including 
permission control and activity auditing. To overcome server constraints, the system utilizes raw 
SQL queries for data operations instead of Django's traditional ORM migration system. This 
project enhances database administration by offering a secure, scalable, and user-friendly 
platform for real-time insights and proactive decision-making.
